# Token Distribution

The equivalent amount of tokens as bond sales are minted for reserve. 5% is allocated to ALDDAO holders (early backers and contributors) and 95% is reserved for boule/boule plus/talent hunter incentives. For this 95%, if the tokens are not used for the epoch, they can be burnt.
