# POL

Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) is the core of Aladdin's liquidity strategy. Through POL, it provides users with permanent liquidity which facilitates exits.

Aladdin will gradually transition from the existing ALD/ETH liquidity incentives to POL.

POL rewards liquidity providers through LP bonding process, which means LPs holding ALD/ETH, ALD/USDC can bond to get discounted ALD.

At the same time, part of the bonding profits from each epoch will be distributed to POL. The initial default rate is 50%.  &#x20;

In conclusion, there will be no fixed cap on the number of ALD issuance. Instead, the issuance speed depends on demand for bonding and rewardRate. RewardRate is determined by community governance.
