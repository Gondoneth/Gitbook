# F(x) 2.0

f(x) Protocol 2.0 builds upon the foundation of f(x) Protocol 1.0, retaining the robust stablecoin design of fxUSD while significantly enhancing the leveraged position tool, xPOSITION. By eliminating individual liquidation risk and funding fees, the protocol provides users with a fully decentralized trading tool offering up to 10X fixed leverage. The upgraded stability mechanisms and streamlined user experience further drive the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi).
