# veFXN and Revenue Distribution

f(x) will adopt ve tokenomics. Locking FXN will receive veFXN. The longer the lock time, the more veFXN received. 75% of treasury revenue will be distributed to veFXN holders. 25% of the revenue will go into reserve pool to incentivize fToken redemption and xToken minting after Stability Pool capital is exhausted

1 FXN locked for 4 years = 1 veFXN

1 FXN locked for 3 years = 0.75 veFXN

1 FXN locked for 2 years = 0.5 veFXN

1 FXN locked for 1 year = 0.25 veFXN
