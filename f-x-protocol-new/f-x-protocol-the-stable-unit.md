# F(x) Protocol: The Stable Unit

Decentralized stablecoins are the cornerstone of Web3â€™s economic infrastructure. However, most existing stablecoins face issues such as centralization risks, scalability limitations, and inefficiencies. f(x) Protocol introduces decentralized solutions to these challenges with innovative token mechanisms.

#### Overview of f(x) Stablecoin Products (fTokens)

* fETH: Maintains low volatility while remaining native to Ethereum, ensuring no reliance on external fiat assets or off-chain entities.
* fxUSD: A USD-pegged stablecoin backed by stETH and frxETH designed for decentralized liquidity pools and on-chain trading, providing high scalability.
* rUSD: A USD-pegged stablecoin backed by eETH and ezETH designed for decentralized liquidity pools and on-chain trading, providing high scalability.
* btcUSD: The first decentralized USD-pegged stablecoin, collateralized with wBTC, enabling new possibilities for BTC yield farming and lending in DeFi ecosystems.
* cvxUSD: cvxUSD is a stablecoin based on CVX that allows users to earn the native staking yield from Convex Finance. Users can stake cvxUSD to stability pools to earn CVX staking yield while remaining pegged to the dollar.
