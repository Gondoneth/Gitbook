# abcCVX Vaults

**What is abcCVX**

The underlying asset of abcCVX is a combination of [CVX/clevCVX LP](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-209/deposit) and clevCVX Furnace deposits. The income source is Convex staking yields from the LP and clevCVX arbitrage between LP and Furnace.

Depositing is a two-step process: New deposits are locked for one day before abcCVX can be claimed. abcCVX starts to earn after claiming and may also then be [Staked on CLever](https://clever.aladdin.club/#/farming) to earn extra [CLEV](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crypto-140/deposit) rewards



**How much does it cost?**

Concentrator takes a 10% treasury fee and a 2% harvest fee on yields. The fees were collected during the harvest process and distributed to the Treasury and Keeper respectively.
