# FxUSD Introduction

FxUSD protocol is an innovative financial protocol based on Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD), aimed at providing diversified asset management and revenue growth opportunities. As the underlying BaseToken, the FxUSD protocol will support any LSD as the underlying asset in the future, while currently only supporting frxETH and stETH for now. Users can convert BaseToken into fToken and xToken through the Factory mode of the fx protocol, where fToken includes ffrxETH and fstETH. For simplicity, users cannot directly mint fToken but can only mint fxUSD\*. xToken includes xfrxETH and xstETH. The initial Net Asset Values (NAVs) of these assets are all $1, and users can perform Zap in and Zap out operations by depositing supported assets such as crvUSD, Frax, USDC, USDT, ETH, etc.

\*To mitigate the cognitive complexity for users associated with fTokens, an ETF called fxUSD, which comprises a basket of fTokens, is introduced.
