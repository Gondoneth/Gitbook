# Introduction of rUSD

rUSD is the first stablecoin with an LRT-backed mechanism, similar to fxUSD, launched in collaboration with the red-hot @ether\_fi. It allows users to farm double EtherFi and additional Eigenlayer points.&#x20;

Backed solely by LRTs, rUSD promises to revolutionize DeFi with its perfect USD peg, efficient liquidity generation for backing collateral, and impressive yields for stakers in the rUSD Stability Pool.&#x20;

If you're familiar with fxUSD, rUSD will feel like home. Minting, redeeming, and depositing into Stability Pools are identical processes. The major difference lies in the backing, where fxUSD uses LSDs, while rUSD is powered by LRTs, offering users higher incentives.&#x20;

Users who mint rUSD from $eETH can deposit into rUSD Stability Pool and earn ETH staking rewards, Eigenlayer points, double EtherFi points, and $ FXN emissions! rUSD will offer \~30% more LRT and Eigen points than eETH!
