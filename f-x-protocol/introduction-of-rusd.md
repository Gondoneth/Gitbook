# Introduction of rUSD

rUSD is a **stablecoin** that uses the same mechanism as fxUSD, but with its reserve comprised of only ETH Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT), starting with Ether.fiâ€™s eETH and Renzo Protocol's ezETH.&#x20;

Even though the risk profile of LRTs are different enough to LSTs that they should not be included in fxUSD, restaked ETH is an excellent use-case for the powerful f(x) mechanism. Stability Pool depositors can earn very high restaking rewards, including points, all without taking ETH price exposure.&#x20;

In fact, since 100% of reserve points flow to the rUSD Stability Pool, along with 50% of LST yields, points accrual in the rUSD Stability Pool is much higher, dollar for dollar, than holding the LST itself!
