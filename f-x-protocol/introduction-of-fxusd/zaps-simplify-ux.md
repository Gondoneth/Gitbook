# Zaps Simplify UX

Much of the complexity of the mechanism discussed in this article will be entirely hidden, and the process will be optimized to feel seamless and straightforward. Zapping will make entering and exiting directly from ETH, LSDs or stables simple and painless, automatically routing where appropriate to account for availability, risk limits, and liquidity. When providing ETH or a constituent LSD these swaps are also slippage free, since they use f(x) minting and redeeming (of course, these transactions still incur gas costs).Deposit function supports both zap in and zap out. Supported assets include crvUSD, Frax, USDC, USDT, ETH, frxETH, stETH, ETH.
