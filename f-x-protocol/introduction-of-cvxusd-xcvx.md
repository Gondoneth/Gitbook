# Introduction of cvxUSD/xCVX

**What are cvxUSD and xCVX?**

**cvxUSD** is a **stablecoin** based on CVX that allows users to earn the native staking yield from Convex Finance.&#x20;

On the volatility side, like what f(x) did, **xCVX** offers up to 3x leverage on CVX with no funding costs or liquidation risk. Users can earn CVX staking yield while remaining pegged to the dollar.

**When Seed Vault and How?**

To ensure system stability, we're opening a seed vault for CVX. The vault will be capped at 200,000 CVX. Convex and f(x) will coincentivize the vault. Be among the first to deposit and receive a 50%+ yield! â€‹ The seed vault will open on **Tuesday, July 16th, at 2 PM UTC** and will run for one week. You can withdraw from the vault at any time, but we'll reserve half of the rewards for users who stay until the last day. If you remain in the vault for the full week, your deposit will be withdrawable as a 50-50 split of **cvxUSD** and **xCVX**.
