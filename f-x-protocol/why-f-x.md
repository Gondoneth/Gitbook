# Why f(x)?

f(x) Protocol is built to create a symbiotic system that decomposes ETH into two useful tokens.&#x20;

For fETH, the goal is to produce a low volatility token which:

1. Is fully decentralized and Ethereum-native;
2. Minimizes volatility while retaining a small exposure to the market;
3. Can be minted and redeemed instantly in direct response to stablecoin demand;
4. Has maximum liquidity depth based on a multiple of demand for xETH, rather than a fraction of demand for CDPs.

Specifically for xETH, we create a leveraged long ETH token which:

1. Is fully decentralized and Ethereum-native;
2. Is composable, with liquidity on-chain;
3. Has an extremely low risk of liquidation.
