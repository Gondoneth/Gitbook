# Stability Pool

There is one stability pool for every stable-leverage pair on f(x). When stable holders deposit there, they earn part of the yields generated by the reserve plus FXN emissions.

If the stable-leverage pair is ever at risk of becoming unstable because of too much minted stable and not enough minted x token, stables in the stability pool are redeemed for reserve assets at their NAV. If the protocol enters stability mode, for stability pool users it is like automatically buying ETH (or whatever the reserve token is) at market price, with no slippage. Otherwise itâ€™s farming unstable, real yields using stable coins.
